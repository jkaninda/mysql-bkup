## Quickstart

### Simple backup using Docker CLI

To run a one time backup, bind your local volume to `/backup` in the container and run the `backup` command:

```shell
 docker run --rm --network your_network_name \
 -v $PWD/backup:/backup/ \
 -e "DB_HOST=dbhost" \
 -e "DB_USERNAME=username" \
 -e "DB_PASSWORD=password" \
 jkaninda/mysql-bkup backup -d database_name
```

Alternatively, pass a `--env-file` in order to use a full config as described below.

```yaml
 docker run --rm --network your_network_name \
 --env-file your-env-file \
 -v $PWD/backup:/backup/ \
 jkaninda/mysql-bkup backup -d database_name
```

### Simple backup in docker compose file

```yaml
services:
  mysql-bkup:
    # In production, it is advised to lock your image tag to a proper
    # release version instead of using `latest`.
    # Check https://github.com/jkaninda/mysql-bkup/releases
    # for a list of available releases.
    image: jkaninda/mysql-bkup
    container_name: mysql-bkup
    command: backup
    volumes:
      - ./backup:/backup
    environment:
      - DB_PORT=3306
      - DB_HOST=mysql
      - DB_NAME=foo
      - DB_USERNAME=bar
      - DB_PASSWORD=password
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    # mysql-bkup container must be connected to the same network with your database
    networks:
       - web
networks:
  web:
```
### Docker recurring backup

```shell
 docker run --rm --network network_name \
 -v $PWD/backup:/backup/ \
 -e "DB_HOST=hostname" \
 -e "DB_USERNAME=user" \
 -e "DB_PASSWORD=password" \
 jkaninda/mysql-bkup backup -d dbName --cron-expression "@every 15m" #@midnight
```

          command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - backup -d dbname

              cpu: "500m"
          env:
            - name: DB_HOST
              value: "mysql"
            - name: DB_USERNAME
              value: "user"
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              value: "password"
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /backup
              name: backup
      volumes:
        - name: backup
          hostPath:
            path: /home/toto/backup # directory location on host
            type: Directory # this field is optional
      restartPolicy: Never
```

## Available image registries

This Docker image is published to both Docker Hub and the GitHub container registry.
Depending on your preferences and needs, you can reference both `jkaninda/mysql-bkup` as well as `ghcr.io/jkaninda/mysql-bkup`:

```
docker pull jkaninda/mysql-bkup
docker pull ghcr.io/jkaninda/mysql-bkup
```

Documentation references Docker Hub, but all examples will work using ghcr.io just as well.

## Supported Engines

This image is developed and tested against the Docker CE engine and Kubernetes exclusively.
While it may work against different implementations, there are no guarantees about support for non-Docker engines.

## References

We decided to publish this image as a simpler and more lightweight alternative because of the following requirements:

- The original image is based on `alpine` and requires additional tools, making it heavy.
- This image is written in Go.
- `arm64` and `arm/v7` architectures are supported.
- Docker in Swarm mode is supported.
- Kubernetes is supported.
