# Migrate database

To migrate the database, you need to add `migrate` command.

{: .note }
The Mysql backup has another great feature: migrating your database from a source database to a target.

As you know, to restore a database from a source to a target database, you need 2 operations: which is to start by backing up the source database and then restoring the source backed database to the target database.
Instead of proceeding like that, you can use the integrated feature `(migrate)`, which will help you migrate your database by doing only one operation.

{: .warning }
The `migrate` operation is irreversible, please backup your target database before this action.

### Docker compose
```yml
services:
  mysql-bkup:
    # In production, it is advised to lock your image tag to a proper
    # release version instead of using `latest`.
    # Check https://github.com/jkaninda/mysql-bkup/releases
    # for a list of available releases.
    image: jkaninda/mysql-bkup
    container_name: mysql-bkup
    command: migrate
    volumes:
      - ./backup:/backup
    environment:
      ## Source database
      - DB_PORT=3306
      - DB_HOST=mysql
      - DB_NAME=database
      - DB_USERNAME=username
      - DB_PASSWORD=password
      ## Target database
      - TARGET_DB_HOST=target-mysql
      - TARGET_DB_PORT=3306
      - TARGET_DB_NAME=dbname
      - TARGET_DB_USERNAME=username
      - TARGET_DB_PASSWORD=password
    # mysql-bkup container must be connected to the same network with your database
    networks:
