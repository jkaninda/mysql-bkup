# Encrypt backup

The image supports encrypting backups using one of two available methods: GPG with passphrase or GPG with a public key

## Using GPG passphrase

The image supports encrypting backups using GPG out of the box. In case a `GPG_PASSPHRASE` or `GPG_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable is set, the backup archive will be encrypted using the given key and saved as a sql.gpg file instead or sql.gz.gpg.

{: .warning }
To restore an encrypted backup, you need to provide the same GPG passphrase used during backup process.

- GPG home directory `/config/gnupg`
- Cipher algorithm `aes256`

{: .note }
The backup encrypted using `GPG passphrase` method can be restored automatically, no need to decrypt it before restoration.


To decrypt manually, you need to install `gnupg`

```shell
gpg --batch --passphrase "my-passphrase" \
--output database_20240730_044201.sql.gz \
--decrypt database_20240730_044201.sql.gz.gpg
```
Using your private key

```shell
gpg --output database_20240730_044201.sql.gz --decrypt database_20240730_044201.sql.gz.gpg
```
### Backup

```yml
services:
  mysql-bkup:
    # In production, it is advised to lock your image tag to a proper
    # release version instead of using `latest`.
    # Check https://github.com/jkaninda/mysql-bkup/releases
    # for a list of available releases.
    image: jkaninda/mysql-bkup
    container_name: mysql-bkup
    command: backup -d database
    volumes:
      - ./backup:/backup
    environment:

      - DB_HOST=mysql
      - DB_NAME=database

      ## Required to encrypt backup
      - GPG_PASSPHRASE=my-secure-passphrase
